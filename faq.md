We prioritize additions based on user requests.

### Why can't I find my medication?

4. **Not available in that country** - Some medications are country-specific
5. **Offline mode** - Reconnect to internet for full database

### Are the brand names accurate?

We strive for accuracy using trusted sources (RxNorm, OpenFDA, pharmacopeia data), but:
- Brand names can vary by region within countries
- New brands are constantly introduced
- Some brands may be discontinued

**Always verify with a local pharmacist before purchasing.**

### What if the brand name I see isn't available locally?

Brand availability can vary by:
- City or region
